The error in the model used to evaluate bids in the InterCity West Coast franchise competition in 2012 led to unforeseen costs to taxpayers of £54 million (as reported in our Forecasting report). It was this case that prompted HMT to commission the Macpherson review of the quality assurance of modelling, which recommended that departments put in place the right processes and culture to       support quality assurance.So what goes wrong? Typically the problems relate to: <br><ul><li>Limited or poor quality data; <li>Unrealistic assumptions and optimism bias – an issue we addressed previously in our blog The art of spending public money wisely and our paper on Over-optimism in government projects; and/or<li>Inadequate sensitivity and scenario analysis. These factors – and an actual lack of forecasting or modelling – were the key weaknesses found in 71 reviewed NAO studies undertaken between 2010 and 2013, as detailed in Forecasting in government to achieve value for money.",
